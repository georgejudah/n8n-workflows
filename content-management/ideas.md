# Content Management Automation - Ideas

## Workflows Built

1. **Audio Transcription from Google Drive** - Automatically transcribe audio files uploaded to Google Drive using OpenAI, generate summaries, and process meeting notes or voice recordings into text

2. **AI Audio Transcriber with Notion Integration** - Watch Google Drive "Recordings" folder, download audio files, transcribe with OpenAI Whisper, generate structured summaries (title, main points, action items, stories, etc.) using GPT-4, and automatically create organized Notion pages with the results

3. **AI Document Summariser** - Monitor Google Drive folder for new documents, extract content from Google Docs, generate AI summaries using GPT-4 with Wikipedia context, and automatically log document title, summary, and timestamp to a Google Sheet tracking database

4. **Veo3 Content Machine** - Automated AI video generation workflow that creates biblical character TikTok-style vlogs. Uses GPT-4o-mini to generate viral video ideas with captions and environment details, converts them to cinematic Veo3 prompts, generates videos via Fal AI, waits for processing, and stores all content (ideas, captions, video URLs) in Google Sheets for content management
